Wrapping up
-----------

Reboot the Pi and you should be all set. Again these are rough
instructions for now :)

You can check that the ``mariner3d`` service is running with:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ sudo systemctl status mariner3d

If it is, you should be able to access it by opening
``http://<pi ip address>:5000/`` on your browser.
